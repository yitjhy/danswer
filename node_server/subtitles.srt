00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,265
Hi everyone, I'm Patrick and in this video I show you how I would learn

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,345
machine learning if I could start over. For context, I'm a machine learning developer

3
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:10,945
advocate at assembly AI and before that I worked several years as

4
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:14,865
software developer and ML engineer and I also teach Python and machine

5
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:18,361
learning on my own YouTube channel. So I would say I'm pretty experienced

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,809
in the field, but I know that the available courses out there

7
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:25,521
can be overwhelming for beginners, so I hope to give you some guidance with this

8
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:29,449
video. The demand for machine learning engineers is still increasing every

9
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:33,029
year, so it's a great skill to have. I divided this learning path

10
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:36,429
into seven steps that should take you about three months to finish.

11
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,917
Of course, this can vary depending on how much time and effort you want to

12
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:43,245
put into this, and I know that everyone learns differently or might

13
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:47,077
have different goals. So this is just my personal take on how

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,597
to learn machine learning. You can use this guide if you just want to explore

15
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,933
machine learning as a hobby, but also if you plan to find a job in

16
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:57,165
the field. I will mention a few more tips about the job search

17
00:00:57,205 --> 00:01:01,015
in the end. So let's jump into the study plan. The first thing I recommend

18
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:04,615
is to lay the foundation with some math basics. Now you might

19
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:08,591
say math is not really necessary anymore, and this is partly true.

20
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:12,071
The available machine learning frameworks abstract the math away

21
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:15,623
and I know many machine learning engineers so don't need it in their day job

22
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:18,743
at all. However, in my opinion, knowing the underlying

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,567
math provides you with a better foundation and better understanding of how the

24
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,191
algorithms work and it makes your life easier when you run into

25
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:29,847
problems. Also, I think there is beauty in the underlying

26
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:33,607
math that makes the machines learn. So for me, knowing the

27
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,575
math sparked my excitement even more. Now you don't need to get too deep

28
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:40,903
into this. A great website with free resources is Khan

29
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,943
Academy. So my recommendation is just to take some basic courses

30
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:48,399
and then move on. And then later when you do the actual machine

31
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:51,735
learning course and don't understand everything, then come back here

32
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:55,143
and learn the missing topics. Oh, and by the way, you find all the resources

33
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,387
and recommendations recommended courses in the description below. The next step is

34
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:01,619
to learn Python. It is the number one programming language

35
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:05,635
for machine learning and there is no way around it. All major machine

36
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:09,419
learning frameworks are built with it and all major courses use Python

37
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,955
for their exercises. So having decent Python skills is

38
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:16,539
essential to build machine learning projects. Now, you don't need to become

39
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:20,147
an advanced software developer, but a little bit more than the beginner level would

40
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,675
be great. One great thing about Python is that it is very beginner

41
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:27,085
friendly and in my opinion it's the best first programming language

42
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,573
you can learn. I recommend two free courses on YouTube,

43
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,429
one four hour beginner course and one six hour intermediate course

44
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:37,685
and then you should have a solid base. This step is what I call the

45
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,797
Machine learning tech stack and consists of the most important Python libraries

46
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,661
for machine learning, data science and data visualization. This step is

47
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:49,053
a bit optional because you can also pick up these skills later when you do

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,005
the actual machine learning course, but I think it's great to build the foundation

49
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,509
first and then it will be easier later. The three libraries I recommend

50
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:59,897
at this point are Numpy, which is the base for everything,

51
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,673
Pandas, which is important for data handling and matplotlib,

52
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,633
which is needed for visualization. These libraries are used in almost every

53
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,129
machine learning project. That's why I would include them in your learning path

54
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:14,817
at this point. Again, you don't need to learn too much here.

55
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,809
I recommend just following one free crash course for each library

56
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:22,257
and then later pick up more advanced concepts if you need them.

57
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:25,677
At this point you don't have to learn the machine learning courses like SciKit,

58
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:29,685
Learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch. You could of course if you want, but these are

59
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:33,221
included in the machine learning course. I show you in a moment so you

60
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:36,429
can pick these up later. Now that we've covered the coding skills,

61
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:39,693
it is finally time for the actual machine learning course.

62
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,573
There are many great ones available, but the most popular and in my

63
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,429
opinion also one of the best ones is the machine learning specialization

64
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:51,413
by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This specialization includes three

65
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,199
courses. It got revamped just a few months ago and now includes

66
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,771
Python with numpy, scikit Learn and tensorflow for the code.

67
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:02,411
So you not only learn all the essential machine learning concepts,

68
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:06,363
but also get your first hands on experience with the ML libraries.

69
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,731
It is extensive and it takes several weeks to finish, but it's

70
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:13,355
worth it. After these courses I have one more recommendation for you.

71
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:16,955
I suggest to implement a few algorithms from scratch in

72
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,417
Python using only Pure Python and NumPy, for example

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,091
by following my ML from scratch playlist here on YouTube.

74
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,743
This is completely optional, but it helped me to properly understand understand some

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,527
of the concepts from Android's course and a lot of students have told me

76
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:34,823
the same feedback, so check it out if you want to. Also, we plan to

77
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,167
release an updated version of the ML from Scratch course here

78
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:42,135
on the Assembly AI channel, so make sure to subscribe to our channel and

79
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:45,639
don't miss it. Now I recommend getting even more hands on and learning

80
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:48,975
more about data preparation for this Kaggle has

81
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:52,447
awesome free courses on their website. I recommend at least the

82
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:55,913
intro to ML and intermediate ML courses. They are

83
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:59,897
lightweight compared to the previous one and some material is just a refresher for

84
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,073
you, but you'll learn more about data preprocessing and data preparation

85
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,345
with Pandas. Each lesson has a theory part and then some coding exercises.

86
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:12,425
It also gives you a gentle introduction to the Kaggle platform and you learn

87
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,841
how to make code submissions on Kaggle, which is perfect for the

88
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:19,465
next point. Now it's time to practice as much as possible

89
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,099
and apply your knowledge to real world machine learning problems.

90
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:27,055
For this, the best platform is Kaggle.com it provides

91
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:30,975
thousands of different data sets and challenges where you can participate.

92
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:34,103
Participating in challenges can motivate you a lot.

93
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,615
Now I wouldn't try making it to the top or even winning prize money

94
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:41,023
with this because to be honest, this requires true expertise

95
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,239
and also a lot of GPU power. But I would

96
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:47,847
still try to tweak your solutions multiple times by

97
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:51,903
learning more about data pre processing and also about hyperparameter

98
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,429
tuning. You can then use Kaggle competitions to build your portfolio

99
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:59,597
and put them on your cv. So in my opinion, Kaggle is an awesome

100
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,157
platform and you should practice here as much as possible. Of course, you can

101
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:06,349
also tackle other machine learning problems outside of Kaggle.

102
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:09,677
It just makes your life a little bit easier because it provides you with

103
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:13,197
the datasets, a platform to evaluate the projects, and there's

104
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:16,981
a whole community around it. At this point you can already be super proud

105
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,445
of yourself. And now in this last section I want to give you a few

106
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:24,529
more tips if your goal is to get a job. The tasks of ML engineers

107
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,721
vary a lot and it's not possible to know everything. For example, some positions

108
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,145
are specialized in computer vision or nlp, or they

109
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:35,905
require you to have experience with a specific ML framework or even

110
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,746
MLOps requirements like how to deploy and scale ML apps.

111
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,977
MLOps is a whole field on its own, so I may cover this in a

112
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:46,337
separate video. My point is you have to decide in which field you

113
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:50,465
want to work and then look at the requirements in some corresponding job descriptions

114
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:54,117
and then specialize in this direction. Another great tip I can give

115
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:57,789
you, and this is something I wish I had done earlier in my career,

116
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,205
is to start a blog. You can write tutorials, share what you've

117
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,893
learned, which projects you have built, which problems you have faced along the

118
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,453
way, and how you've solved them by writing about a topic, you can deepen your

119
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,701
knowledge and then you can use this as a resource on your cv. Trust me,

120
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,829
this will increase your chances to get an interview a lot.

121
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:19,653
All right, that's my recommendation for a machine learning study guide. Again,

122
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,229
this might not be suited for everyone. This is just how I would learn

123
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,729
machine learning if I had to start over. Just one more quick addition.

124
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:30,449
If you prefer learning with books, then you can check out these two books.

125
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:33,801
Let me know in the comments if this was helpful or if you have any

126
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,257
other suggestions you would add to the plan. Don't forget to check

127
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:40,513
out the resource list I put in the description below and then I hope to

128
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,873
see you in the next video.
